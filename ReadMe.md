# Phase 1: Inventory App Models

## Instructions

* Go through all the files and trace their paths. Read through all the code to get an understanding of what's there. Code that's missing will have a comment saying in which section it needs to be added

* The goal for this phase is to write three API routes and your inventory mongoose model. First, create your inventory mongoose model. Use previous activities as a guide.

* Your model must include one field called `itemName`. It needs to be a string, it must be unique, and it must be required and have an error message if it is not included.

* Your model must include another field called `itemCount`. It needs to be a string, and it must be required and have an error message if it is not included.

* Your model must include another field called `itemID`. It needs to be a string, it must be unique, and it must be required and have an error message if it is not included.
    
    
# Phase 2: Inventory App Routes
    
## Instructions
    
* Next you need to write the following into the api-routes.js file:
    
* A GET route to `/api/inventory` that will find everything from the Mongo database and return it to the client using `res.json`
    
* A POST route to `/api/inventory` that will create a new document in the inventory Mongo collection from whatever is given by the client and return the response to the client using `res.json`
    
* A PUT route to `/api/inventory` that will update an existing document by its `itemID` field and set the value of `itemCount` to the incoming itemCount. Then return whatever the response is using `res.json`


# Phase 3: Inventory App Tests
    
## Instructions
    
* Test your routes and model using Postman. Your data should be formatted like so:
    
* POST request should include `itemCount`, `itemID`, and `itemName`
    
* PUT request should include `itemCount` and `itemID`


# Phase 4: Inventory App AJAX
    
## Instructions
    
* For this phase, open the `app.js` file in the `public` folder and add the three AJAX methods to make a GET request, POST request, and PUT request. Follow the directions inside the `app.js` file.
    
* All the HTML is written. You only need to fill in the JavaScript for the AJAX methods and what goes inside of them.
    
* Write one method at a time and then test it before moving on to the next.


# Phase 5: Inventory App Deploy
    
## Instructions
    
* Upload this app to a Github repo and then deploy this app to Heroku
